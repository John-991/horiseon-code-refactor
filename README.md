# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description 
The Horiseon Code Refactor Template is a static webpage offered by Horiseon. I aimed to improve my HTML and CSS skills and create a accessible design. The project stands out with its clean layout, semantic HTML, and visually engaging styling.

Enhancements Implemented:

1. **Redundant Classes Consolidated:**
   - Removed redundant classes to streamline the CSS code and improve maintainability.

2. **Semantic HTML Elements:**
   - Replaced generic HTML elements with semantic HTML elements for improved document structure and accessibility.

3. **Alt Text for Images:**
   - Added descriptive alt text to images for better accessibility and user experience.

4. **Explanatory Comments in HTML:**
   - Inserted explanatory comments within the HTML document to provide clarity and context for different sections.

5. **Reorganized CSS Structure:**
   - Restructured the CSS code to follow a logical and organized layout for easier readability and maintenance.

6. **Separation of Classes and Elements:**
   - Separated CSS classes and elements, organizing them alphabetically within each group for a systematic arrangement.

7. **Comments for Code Sections:**
   - Added comments in the CSS file to delineate each section, making it easier to navigate and understand the purpose of specific code blocks.

8. **Descriptive Title Added:**
   - Included a descriptive title in the HTML document to provide clear and concise information about the webpage's content.
